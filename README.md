# POC
Proof of Concept

This is a java project named Library Management.
It consists of core java concepts.
Here I decided to use hashmap due to it's ease of use and accessibility.
Based on user requirement,the values mapped with keys can be accessed.
Here,the library users,books,ID's and authors can be added as well as removed.
You can also see the availability of books to be borrowed.
